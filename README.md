# Lab-2-from-Statistical-modelling
Hi there,let me explain in details this lab work:
Task encompassed next  steps:
1. Create a game using random numbers
2. Find an approximate squares of figures by Monte Carlo method
3. Find minimum and maximum values of given plot.

In the first task I implemented a game,where I generate randomely  20 '1' values on a 8X8 grid.
User is allowed to choose the difficulty level.Your task is too guess all 20 positions where '1' values are hidden.

The second task and third tasks are done in Jupyter Notebook. I guess everything is clear in my pdf_report,
so you should understand all my logic of steps
